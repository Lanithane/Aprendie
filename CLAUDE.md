# Project Rules (read me first)

## Architecture: DDD per bounded context (backend)

The backend (`server/`) is organized by bounded context, each with the same four layers. Never bypass a layer.

```
server/
├── index.ts                          # bootstrap only
├── env.ts                            # zod-validated env
├── types/express.d.ts                # ambient types
├── infrastructure/                   # cross-cutting, no domain logic
│   ├── db/{client,schema,migrate}.ts
│   ├── crypto/encryption.ts          # generic AES-256-GCM
│   ├── claude/{anthropicClient,responseParser}.ts
│   ├── session/sessionMiddleware.ts
│   └── http/{requireAuth,errorHandler}.ts
└── modules/<context>/                # bounded contexts
    ├── domain/                       # pure types, value objects, domain errors. NO I/O.
    ├── application/                  # use cases: orchestrate domain + persistence + infrastructure
    ├── persistence/                  # repository functions; only place Drizzle is touched per module
    └── controllers/                  # Express routers; validate input, call application, shape responses
```

Current contexts: `auth`, `user`, `apiKey`, `sentence`, `correction`, `language` (stateless — `application/` + `controllers/` only, no persistence/domain).

**Layer rules — do not break:**

- **controllers/** import only from `application/`, `domain/`, and `infrastructure/http/`. They translate HTTP ↔ application calls, validate inputs (zod), and shape JSON responses. No business logic, no DB access.
- **application/** imports from `domain/`, `persistence/` (own module), other modules' `application/` (cross-module orchestration), and `infrastructure/`. This is the only place use-case logic lives.
- **persistence/** imports only Drizzle + `infrastructure/db/`. Exposes plain async functions returning rows or `null`. No HTTP concerns, no Anthropic calls.
- **domain/** has no imports beyond shared types and Drizzle row types. Pure.
- **infrastructure/** never imports from `modules/`. (Exception: `errorHandler` imports module-level error classes so it can map them to status codes — that's the one allowed inversion.)

When adding a new feature, ask: which bounded context owns this? If none, create a new `modules/<name>/` with the four subfolders. If a use case spans two contexts, the orchestrating call lives in one module's `application/` and calls into the other module's `application/` (never directly into another module's persistence).

## Frontend conventions

```
src/
├── api/                              # per-domain fetch wrappers (sentenceApi, correctionApi, ...). Components NEVER call fetch directly.
├── auth/                             # AuthContext + provider
├── components/
│   ├── shared/                       # reusable across pages (LoadingSpinner, SectionCard)
│   └── <Feature>/<Feature>.tsx       # feature components
├── hooks/                            # ALL custom hooks live here, one per file
├── pages/                            # route-level components; thin compositions of hooks + components
├── history/                          # localStorage history (will move server-side eventually)
└── ThemeModeProvider.tsx, routes.tsx, main.tsx, App.tsx
```

### Component rules

- **Pages are thin.** A page composes hooks + components. If a page is >80 lines, you've absorbed logic that belongs in a hook or sub-component.
- **Reach for `components/shared/` first.** Loading states, section cards, etc. — extend the shared component or add a new one rather than inlining MUI again.
- **Styling:** prefer `@emotion/styled` template literals (`styled.div`...`) over `sx` for non-trivial styles. See [feedback in memory] / BLUEPRINT.md.

### `useEffect` rules

- **Don't reach for `useEffect` first.** Prefer derived state, event handlers, and `useMemo`.
- **When `useEffect` is genuinely required** (data fetching on mount, subscribing to external state like `storage` events / `matchMedia`, focusing a DOM node on prop change), extract it into a custom hook in `src/hooks/`. Pages and components should not own `useEffect` calls directly.
- Naming: `use<Noun>` for data hooks (`useCurrentSentence`, `useHistory`), `use<NounPref>` for persisted preferences (`useLanguagePair`, `useLevelPreference`).
- Provider components (`AuthProvider`, `ThemeModeProvider`) are the one exception — they may hold an effect for the global subscription they own.

### API layer

- Components and hooks call functions from `src/api/<domain>Api.ts`, never `fetch` directly.
- `src/api/client.ts` owns the single `fetch` wrapper and the `ApiError` type. Domain modules build on top of it.

## Shared types

`shared/` holds types imported by both `src/` and `server/`. Keep it small — only what genuinely crosses the wire or is a shared registry: `shared/languages.ts` (the language/locale registry, `LanguagePair`, `WordToken`) and `shared/levels.ts` (the CEFR-aligned `LEVELS` ladder). Don't put domain logic here.

## Lint / format

Code style is enforced by ESLint + Prettier (config in `eslint.config.js`, `prettier.config.cjs`): single quotes, no semicolons, 2-space indent, 100-col width. Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` before declaring work done.

## When in doubt

If a refactor would break one of the layer rules above, stop and either re-shape the change so it doesn't, or surface the conflict to the user — don't quietly route around the architecture.
